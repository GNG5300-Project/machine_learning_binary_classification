# The Goal of This Project

The goal of this machine learning project is to develop a predictive model for loan risk assessment, utilizing a dataset of individual loan applications. The model aims to predict the likelihood of loan default based on various applicant features, such as age, income, loan amount, credit score, employment details, and more. By accurately predicting defaults, financial institutions can better manage risk, make informed lending decisions, and reduce potential losses. The insights gained from this model can also help tailor loan products to different customer profiles, enhancing overall financial stability and customer satisfaction.

## Steps

The following sections outline the steps in this process.

###

### Initial Data Introspection

To gain a comprehensive understanding of our dataset and ensure we are well-prepared for building the pipeline, we start with a simple Jupyter notebook. Note however that we do not perform any transformation processes in this notebook as they will be handled in the pipeline. We use the notebook to determine the state of the data in order to plan these transformation and intemediate processing in the pipeline. This step is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Content Exploration:** We first explore the contents of the dataset to get a sense of the data types, sample values, and overall structure. This helps us identify any immediate issues or areas that need attention.
2. **Schema Analysis:** We define and analyze the schema of the data. This step ensures that we have a clear understanding of the expected data types, ranges, and constraints for each feature, which is critical for subsequent processing and validation.
3. **Statistical Overview:** By generating descriptive statistics, we can quickly spot central tendencies, dispersion, and the presence of outliers. This statistical overview is essential for informing our preprocessing and feature engineering steps.
4. **Anomaly Detection**: We use the notebook to identify any anomalies in the data. Detecting anomalies early helps prevent unexpected issues during model training and ensures the quality and reliability of our data. In our case there were no anomalies.
5. **Data Skew and Imbalance**: Analyzing data skew and imbalance is vital for developing robust models. Understanding these aspects allows us to implement appropriate techniques, such as resampling or reweighting, to mitigate their impact on model performance. There was significant data imbalance in the Label column with a ratio of 88:12 for Default:Non-default clients.

By performing these preliminary analyses, we lay the groundwork for a smooth and efficient pipeline development process, ensuring that our data is well-understood and prepared for subsequent machine learning tasks.

# Building the Local Pipeline using TFX

Building a local machine learning pipeline using TensorFlow Extended (TFX) involves several well-defined steps. Each step is crucial for transforming raw data into a deployable machine learning model. Hereâ€™s a detailed outline of the steps we used:

## 1\. Data Ingestion

**Component:** ExampleGen

**Module file:** N/A

**Description**: The ExampleGen component ingests the raw data into the TFX pipeline. It splits the data into training and evaluation sets. This step ensures the data is in a consistent format and ready for further processing. Our split was 70:30. Where 70 was used for training and 30 used for evaluation.

## 2\. Data Validation

**Component**: StatisticsGen, SchemaGen, ExampleValidator

**Module file:** N/A

**Description**:

- StatisticsGen: Generates statistics for the dataset to understand the data distribution.
- SchemaGen: Automatically generates a schema for the data, defining the expected data types and ranges.
- ExampleValidator: Uses the schema and statistics to detect anomalies and missing values in the data.

Given we had already reviewed the data using our Jupyter notebook file, we did not have to make any transformations to correct for anomalies or schema errors. The data was anomaly and schema free.

## 3\. Data Transformation

**Component**: Transform

**Module file:** transform.py

**Description:** The Transform component preprocesses the data. This includes scaling numerical features and categorizing categorical features. The transformation logic is defined in a preprocessing function within the transformer.py file, ensuring that the same transformations are applied during both training and serving.

To prepare the data for training we had to perform scaling and categorization. We split the data columns into Numerical and Categorical features before we began.

### **Scaling:**

Normalizes numerical features to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

### Categorization

1. **Compute Vocabulary:** For each categorical feature, a vocabulary is computed to list all possible values.
2. **Apply Vocabulary:** The computed vocabulary is applied to transform the categorical features into integer indices.
3. **OOV Buckets:** Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) buckets are added to handle any categories in the test or future data that were not seen during training.
4. **One-Hot Encoding:** Converts the integer indices of categorical features into a binary matrix representation.
5. **Transformed Data Naming:** The transformed features are given new names to avoid overwriting the original data using the transformed_name function.

All these are handled in the transformer.py module.

## 4\. Tuning the Machine Learning Model with Bayesian Optimization

In our machine learning pipeline, hyperparameter tuning is a critical step to optimize the model's performance. This process involves searching for the best combination of hyperparameters that yield the highest model accuracy or other relevant metrics. Given the constraints of our machine resources, we employed the Bayesian Optimization approach for hyperparameter tuning using the BayesianOptimization tuner from Keras Tuner and a custom model builder function. The Hyperband tuner showed better promise at lower tuning configurations and would be considered the best tuner of choice for this process but it requires more powerful and expensive cpu/gpu configurations to execute at production levels.

### Steps in the Hyperparameter Tuning Process

#### Model Builder Function

**Description**: The model builder function defines the structure of the model and includes hyperparameters that will be tuned. This function is essential for the tuning process as it specifies which hyperparameters will be searched and their possible ranges.

Components:

1. **Input Layers:** Defines the input shape of the data.
2. **Hidden Layers:** Specifies the number of layers, units in each layer, and activation functions.
3. **Output Layer:** Defines the output layer with the appropriate activation function for the task (e.g., softmax for classification).
4. **Hyperparameters:** Includes learning rate, number of units in each hidden layer, dropout rates, and other relevant parameters.

#### Bayesian Optimization Tuner

**Description**: The Bayesian optimization tuner is used to search for the best hyperparameters efficiently. Bayesian Optimization builds a probabilistic model of the objective function and uses it to select the most promising hyperparameters to evaluate.

Advantages: This method is more sample-efficient compared to random search and grid search, making it suitable for scenarios with limited computational resources.

#### Integration with TFX Pipeline

**Description**: The hyperparameter tuning step is integrated into the TFX pipeline to ensure that the tuned model is used for further training and evaluation.

**Components:**

Tuner Component: A custom TFX component that encapsulates the hyperparameter tuning logic.

## 5\. Training the Machine Learning Model

After determining the best hyperparameters through tuning, we proceed to train the model using these optimized settings. In our case, we settled for a feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as it showed more promise compared to a convolutional neural network (CNN) for our structured tabular data.

### Overview of the Training Process

#### Model Selection

**Feed-Forward Deep Neural Network**: Based on our data's nature and preliminary experiments, we found that a feed-forward DNN outperformed other architectures, including CNNs, in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. The DNN's architecture includes multiple dense layers, each followed by activation functions and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

#### Hyperparameter Tuning Results

**Best Hyperparameters:** Through the Bayesian Optimization tuner, we identified the optimal hyperparameters for our model. This was used for the training data. An example of this information from one of our training sessions is shown below:

  }
}
```

**Module**: trainer_local.py (which is specifically configured for our local training environment)

**Components**:

Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the training and validation datasets from the Tfx pipeline.

**Model Definition**: Use the best hyperparameters to build the model architecture.

Compilation: Compile the model with the Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.

**Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.

## 6\. Model Resolver

**Components**: Resolver

**Module**: N/A

**Description**: The Model Resolver component is responsible for retrieving the latest blessed model. A blessed model is one that has passed all validation checks and is deemed suitable for deployment. By ensuring that only the latest and most effective model is used for further validation and comparison, the Model Resolver helps maintain a high standard for the models deployed in production.

## 7\. Model Evaluator

**Components**: Tensorflow Model Analysis

**Module**: N/A

**Description**: The Evaluator component is essential for assessing the performance of the newly trained model. It uses TensorFlow Model Analysis (TFMA) to compute various metrics and determine if the new model meets the required performance thresholds compared to the baseline model.

## Pusher Component

**Module**: N/A

**Components**: Pusher

**Input Dependencies**: The Pusher component typically depends on the outputs of both the Trainer and Evaluator components.

It requires the trained model artifact (model) from the Trainer component.

It also needs the model blessing (model_blessing) from the Evaluator component to ensure that only validated models are pushed to production.

**Functionality**:

1. **Validation**: The Pusher verifies that the model has been blessed (validated) before proceeding with deployment.
2. **Versioning**: It manages versioning of models to ensure that each deployment is uniquely identified and can be tracked.
3. **Deployment**: The Pusher orchestrates the deployment of the validated model to a specified deployment target (e.g., TensorFlow Serving, Kubernetes, etc.).
